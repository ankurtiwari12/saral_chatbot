    "previous_answer": "Based on the provided context, I will create three slides for self-attention as follows:\n\n**Slide 1: What is Self-Attention?**\n\n* Definition: Self-attention is an attention mechanism that relates different positions of a single sequence to compute a representation of the sequence.\n* Description: It has been used successfully in various tasks such as reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment, and learning task-independent sentence representations.\n\n[No additional information needed from outside context]\n\n**Slide 2: Advantages of Self-Attention**\n\n* Computational complexity: Self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d.\n* Parallelizability: Self-attention can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n* Neighborhood consideration: To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r.\n\n[No additional information needed from outside context]\n\n**Slide 3: How Does Self-Attention Work?**\n\n* Scaled Dot-Product Attention: The attention function is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\n* Query, keys, and values are packed together into matrices Q, K, and V, respectively. The matrix of outputs is computed using the softmax function.\n\n[Note: Additional information from Figure 2 is used to describe the computation process]\n\nI hope this meets your requirements!",
